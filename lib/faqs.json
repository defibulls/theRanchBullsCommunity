      "answer": "If you don't hold any TR Bulls NFTs, you won't be able to participate in certain parts of the TR Bulls ecosystem, such as Bull Battles, Death Battles, voting, or rewards distribution.

    {
      "question": "What happens to my NFT if I lose in a Death Battle?",

      "type": "Battles"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Death Battles impact the supply of Bullion?",
      "answer": "Death Battles are a way to increase the amount of Bullion for an NFT. However, this will also reduce the overall supply of Bullion, as the defeated NFT will only receive 75% of the Bullion from the battle. This mechanism ensures that Bullion remains deflationary and scarce, adding value to the NFTs and incentivizing community engagement.",
      "type": "Battles"
    },
    {
      "question": "How is the monthly Bullion supply determined?",
      "answer": "The monthly Bullion supply is determined via a snapshot on the smart contract as all the wallet addresses that have staked their NFTs and the smart contract calculates the Total Bullion from all the NFTs that those wallets own to determine to total Bullion Supply for the Month.",

      "type": "Bullion"
    },
    {
      "question": "How is Bullion calculated and what is its value?",
      "answer": "Bullion itself does not have a fixed value. Instead, it serves as a basis for calculating the percentage of rewards each stakeholder receives based on their staked amount and voting activity. At the start of each month, the smart contract computes the total bullion accumulated by the staked owner across all NFTs they possess. The bullion is then deliberately calculated to determine the reward allocation ratio for that month's reward tokens.",
      "type": "Bullion"
    },
    {
      "question": "How is bullion distributed and what is the crucial reward eligibility requirement?",
      "answer": "Before distributing rewards to stakeholders, the bullion is deliberately calculated to determine the reward allocation ratio for that month's reward tokens. After rewards are dispensed, all bullion is wiped from stakeholders' accounts and recalculated the following month to repeat the rewarding process. Regardless of which NFT you stake, the bullion output remains the same. The crucial reward eligibility requirement is to stake at least one NFT and vote for the DAO. Voting can be manually done each month by you or you can delegate your voting tokens to someone else within the community.",
      "type": "Bullion"
    },
    {
      "question": "When are rewards distributed for the project?",
      "answer": "Rewards are distributed monthly to contributors of the TR Bulls DAO based on their staked amount and voting activity. The amount of Bullion accrued by each TR Bull NFT owner determines their percentage of rewards. These rewards are distributed to contributors in the middle of each month, providing them with ample time to participate in marketplace activities that involve the transfer of Bullion among them. The project is designed to incentivize community engagement and reward those who actively participate in the DAO.",
      "type": "Bullion"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I stake my NFT to earn rewards?",
      "answer": "We are building that out now, in terms of the runway for staking. This really comes back to the roadmap AlphaShares has and probably a couple months before rewards come back to the project via the BTC mining in Paraguay in the Summer of 23'. We are building out a 'Town Hall' on the Dapp will be the place where you can enter and pick the Bull you want to stake. Its not there yet but will be soon.",
      "type": "Staking & Governance"
    },
    {
      "question": "Which NFT do I have to stake to vote and be eligible for rewards?",
      "answer": "The specific NFT you stake doesn't matter as long as you stake at least one NFT from your wallet. By staking an NFT, you become eligible to participate in voting and earn rewards based on the amount of Bullion accrued. The amount of Bullion you earn is determined by the total value of the NFTs in your wallet of that staked TR Bull.",
